# tumbdlr
A short script that downloads liked posts from your tumblr. Only pictures and videos are downloaded. Posts with multiple pictures will
result in a folder.

Create a tumblr application. Refer this [guide](https://wpweb.co.in/documents/social-network-integration/tumblr/).
After creating the application, click on 'Explore API' -> allow -> 'Show keys'.
Copy the consumer key, consumer secret, token and token secret strings and put them in keys.txt.
Run the script. Note that 'vids/' and 'pics/' should exist.
